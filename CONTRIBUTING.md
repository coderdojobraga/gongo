   ```sh
   asdf plugin-add python
   ```

   **Note:** You should set `legacy_version_file` to yes on the `asdf` config
   file (read more [here](https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-configuration?id=homeasdfrc))

This file was created when you ran `bin/setup` and is located on the project
directory.

1. Use [this server template](https://discord.com/template/qpH6udHU84sK) to clone
the existing server.

   ```http
   https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<id>&permissions=<permissions>&scope=bot
   ```

   Where `<id>` is your bot's client id found in the
   [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   and `<permissions>` is the **permissions integer** that can be found on the
   bot's page, for now this value is set to `338757952` with the following
